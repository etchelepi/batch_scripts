# batch_scripts
These are a collection of batch scripts I've used over the years to make my life easier in some way

Put the batch script in the folder. Modify it to get the rate or resoultion needed. Double click to run it.

Imporvement to be made is to take things as command line arguments. It might also be nice if there was a way to adjust the images for time lapeses. But that might be better in a python script.
